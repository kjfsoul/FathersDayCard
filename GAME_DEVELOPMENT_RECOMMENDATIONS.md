## Current Game Issues & Recommendations

### Issues Identified
1. **Emoji Match Game**: Can click all emojis without strategy
2. **Memory Game**: Cards should be face-down initially
3. **Thank You Card**: Confusing messaging about perspective
4. **Trivia Game**: Repeats same questions
5. **Ball Game**: Needs more animation

### Recommended Replacements
- Replace emoji match with physics-based slingshot game (Angry Birds style)
- Implement proper memory card flip mechanics
- Fix thank you card messaging
- Add question randomization to trivia
- Enhance ball game with particle effects and smoother animations

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Supabase for authentication

### Backend
- Express.js server
- PostgreSQL database
- Drizzle ORM
- Session-based authentication

### Database Schema
- Users table with subscription tracking
- Father cards storage
- Game sessions logging
- Analytics events

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Professional Game Development**: Migrate to Unity or Phaser.js for advanced physics
2. **AI Image Generation**: Integrate Midjourney or DALL-E for custom avatars
3. **Advanced Animations**: Use Lottie for smooth, professional animations
4. **Sound Design**: Add audio feedback and background music
5. **Social Features**: Card sharing and game leaderboards
